## Implementation Strategy üöÄ

### Sequential Epic Dependencies
Epic 1 ‚Üí Epic 2 ‚Üí Epic 3 ‚Üí Epic 4

### Parallel Feature Development
Features within each epic can be developed in parallel

### Incremental Integration
Each phase builds upon previous foundation

### Cross-Platform Considerations
iOS-first with macOS compatibility layer

### Privacy-First Approach
All features prioritize user privacy and data security

## Technical Architecture Integration

### Existing Foundation
- **MemoryAgent.swift**: Already has `processHealthData()` method (Line 356)
- **MemoryIngestData**: Already supports `.healthData` type (Line 706)
- **Entity.swift**: Extensible EntityType enum ready for health categories
- **EpisodicMemoryEntry.swift**: Rich memory model with embedding support

### New Components to Create
- **Features/Health/** directory structure
- **HealthKitService** for data fetching
- **Health-specific memory models**
- **Health entity types and relationships**
- **Health dashboard UI components**

## Story Point Distribution
- **Epic 1 (Foundation)**: 21 points
- **Epic 2 (Memory)**: 18 points  
- **Epic 3 (Knowledge Graph)**: 15 points
- **Epic 4 (UI/Analytics)**: 13 points
- **Total**: 67 story points

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 epics created in Linear
- [ ] 16 individual features properly scoped and estimated
- [ ] Dependencies clearly mapped between epics
- [ ] Privacy and security considerations documented
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility strategy defined
- [ ] Integration with existing memory system validated
