# 🗑️ How to Remove swift-argument-parser from Xcode

## 😤 I Feel Your Pain!

Xcode dependency management can be incredibly frustrating! Let's get this sorted quickly.

## 🎯 Quick Fix: Remove swift-argument-parser

### **Step 1: Open Your Project**
```bash
open ProjectOne.xcodeproj
```

### **Step 2: Remove the Problematic Dependency**

1. **In Xcode, click on your project name** (ProjectOne) in the navigator
2. **Select the "ProjectOne" target** (not the project)
3. **Go to the "General" tab**
4. **Scroll down to "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"**
5. **Find "ArgumentParser" in the list**
6. **Click the "-" button to remove it**

### **Step 3: Alternative Method (Package Dependencies)**

If you don't see it in Frameworks:

1. **Click on your project name** in the navigator
2. **Go to "Package Dependencies" tab**
3. **Find "swift-argument-parser" in the list**
4. **Select it and press Delete key**
5. **Or right-click and select "Remove Package"**

### **Step 4: Clean Everything**

```bash
# In Terminal (I already ran this for you):
rm -rf .build/
rm -rf build/
```

**In Xcode:**
1. **Product → Clean Build Folder**
2. **File → Packages → Reset Package Caches**
3. **Build the project** (⌘+B)

## 🎉 Why This Will Work

- ✅ **You don't use ArgumentParser directly** (I checked your code)
- ✅ **swift-transformers will provide it internally**
- ✅ **WhisperKit will use the compatible version**
- ✅ **No breaking changes to your code**

## 🆘 If Xcode is Still Being Stubborn

### **Nuclear Option:**
1. **Close Xcode completely**
2. **Delete derived data:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ProjectOne-*
   ```
3. **Reopen project and try again**

### **Manual Package.swift Approach:**
If Xcode keeps fighting you, we can create a minimal Package.swift to manage dependencies:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ProjectOne",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v26)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift.git", from: "0.25.6"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git", from: "0.13.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections.git", from: "1.2.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git", from: "8.53.2"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/huggingface/swift-transformers.git", from: "0.1.22"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics", from: "1.0.3"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-atomics.git", from: "1.2.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/1024jp/GzipSwift", from: "6.0.1"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/johnmai-dev/Jinja", from: "1.2.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "ProjectOne",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "MLX", package: "mlx-swift"),
                .product(name: "WhisperKit", package: "WhisperKit"),
                .product(name: "Collections", package: "swift-collections"),
                .product(name: "Sentry", package: "sentry-cocoa"),
                .product(name: "Transformers", package: "swift-transformers"),
                .product(name: "Numerics", package: "swift-numerics"),
                .product(name: "Atomics", package: "swift-atomics"),
                .product(name: "Gzip", package: "GzipSwift"),
                .product(name: "Jinja", package: "Jinja")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

## 🎊 Success!

After removing swift-argument-parser, your dependencies should resolve cleanly and your project should build without issues!

**Remember:** You're not alone in hating Xcode's dependency management - it's a common frustration among iOS developers! 😅
