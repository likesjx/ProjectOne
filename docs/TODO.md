## ‚úÖ Completed TODOs

### üéØ T008 - Transcription Error Investigation & Resolution (2025-07-14)

**PROBLEM**: User reported "still getting an error on the transcription"

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Missing speech recognition permission request + Audio format compatibility
- App was only requesting microphone permission ‚úÖ
- Speech recognition permission was never requested ‚ùå  
- `SFSpeechRecognizer.authorizationStatus()` returned `.notDetermined`
- AppleSpeechTranscriber correctly rejected transcription attempts
- Audio recording used 12kHz sample rate, incompatible with AppleSpeechTranscriber (requires 16kHz+)

**DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS**:
1. Created comprehensive TranscriptionDiagnostic utility (AudioRecorder.swift:94‚Üí117)
2. Analyzed permission flow in AudioRecorder, SpeechEngineFactory, AppleSpeechTranscriber  
3. Identified gap: speech recognition permission missing from `requestPermission()` method
4. Confirmed Info.plist has correct permission descriptions
5. Verified audio format compatibility between recording and transcription engines

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- Updated `AudioRecorder.requestPermission()` to request both permissions sequentially (AudioRecorder.swift:55‚Üí117)
- Added `requestMicrophonePermission()` and `requestSpeechRecognitionPermission()` 
- Added comprehensive logging for permission status debugging
- Updated audio recording sample rate from 12kHz to 16kHz for compatibility (AudioRecorder.swift:141)
- Verified 3-minute timeout configuration is appropriate (AudioRecorder.swift:312)

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- `ProjectOne/AudioRecorder.swift` - Fixed permission request flow and audio format compatibility  
- `ProjectOne/Utils/TranscriptionDiagnostic.swift` - Created diagnostic utility
- `TestPermissions.swift` - Cross-platform permission testing script

**IMPACT**: Resolves primary transcription error preventing voice memo functionality

**TASKS COMPLETED**:
- [x] T008-9: Test end-to-end transcription with both permissions properly requested
- [x] T008-3: Verify audio format compatibility between recording and transcription engines  
- [x] T008-4: Check for timeout issues in 3-minute transcription window
