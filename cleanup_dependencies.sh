echo "üéØ Recommended Cleanup Options:"

echo "Option 1: Use Xcode Project Dependencies (Recommended)"
echo "  - Delete Package.swift"
echo "  - Manage all dependencies in Xcode"
echo "  - Better for iOS app development"
echo ""
echo "Option 2: Use Package.swift (Alternative)"
echo "  - Remove dependencies from Xcode project"
echo "  - Add Package.swift as dependency to Xcode project"
echo "  - Better for library development"

echo "üìù Instructions for Option 1 (Recommended):"
echo "1. Delete Package.swift: rm Package.swift"
echo "2. Open ProjectOne.xcodeproj in Xcode"
echo "3. Go to File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies"
echo "4. Add these packages:"
echo "   - MLX Swift: https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift.git (0.25.6)"

echo "5. Add source files to project"
echo "6. Build and test"

echo "üìù Instructions for Option 2 (Alternative):"
echo "1. Keep Package.swift"
echo "2. Remove all Swift Package Dependencies from Xcode project"
echo "3. Add Package.swift as a dependency to Xcode project"
echo "4. Reference the library target from Package.swift"
