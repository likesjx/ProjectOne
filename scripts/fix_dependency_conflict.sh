echo "🔧 Dependency Conflict Fix Script"
echo "================================="
echo ""

echo "🚨 Problem Identified:"
echo "Version conflict between swift-argument-parser and swift-transformers"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Analysis:"
echo "✅ You're NOT using ArgumentParser directly in your code"
echo "✅ swift-transformers and WhisperKit can manage it internally"
echo "✅ Safe to remove swift-argument-parser from project dependencies"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Solution: Remove swift-argument-parser"
echo ""
echo "Steps to fix:"
echo "1. Open ProjectOne.xcodeproj in Xcode"
echo "2. Go to Project Settings → Package Dependencies"
echo "3. Remove swift-argument-parser from the list"
echo "4. Clean and rebuild"
echo ""

echo "📋 Why this works:"
echo "- swift-transformers will provide ArgumentParser internally"
echo "- WhisperKit will use the compatible version"
echo "- No direct usage in your code means no breaking changes"
echo ""

echo "🧹 Cleanup commands:"
echo "rm -rf .build/"
echo "rm -rf build/"
echo ""
echo "In Xcode:"
echo "- Product → Clean Build Folder"
echo "- File → Packages → Reset Package Caches"
echo "- Build the project (⌘+B)"
echo ""

echo "✅ Expected result:"
echo "- No dependency resolution errors"
echo "- All packages resolve successfully"
echo "- Project builds without issues"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Ready to fix the conflict!"
