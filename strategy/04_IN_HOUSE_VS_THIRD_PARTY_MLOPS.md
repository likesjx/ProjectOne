# MLOps: In-House vs. Third-Party Services

This document analyzes the strategic choice between building our own model training pipeline versus using a third-party "Model Training as a Service" provider (like Google Custom Speech, Azure AI, or AssemblyAI).

## 1. Overview of Options

-   **Third-Party Service:** We would upload our collected `(audio, text)` data to a provider. They would handle the fine-tuning process and provide us with a private API endpoint to access our custom model. We would pay for the training and for every API call made.

-   **In-House Pipeline (Our Chosen Path):** We build and manage the entire MLOps lifecycle using our own server infrastructure, MLX Python for training, LangGraph for orchestration, and Hugging Face for model storage.

## 2. Strategic Comparison

| Feature | Third-Party Service | In-House Pipeline (Our Plan) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Effort & MLOps** | **Low.** The provider abstracts away all the complexity of training, evaluation, and deployment. | **High.** We are responsible for building and maintaining the entire agentic pipeline. This requires significant initial and ongoing engineering effort. |
| **Cost** | **High & Recurring.** We pay a premium for the managed service and a per-use fee for API calls. Costs scale directly with usage. | **Low & Controlled.** Our costs are for raw cloud compute and storage. We do not pay a per-use fee for our own model. The primary cost is developer time. |
| **Control & Customization** | **Medium.** We can provide data, but we cannot control the model architecture, training algorithms, or fine-tuning process. We are using their proprietary, black-box system. | **Total.** We have absolute control over every aspect of the model and the training process. We can innovate at every layer of the stack. |
| **Data Privacy** | **Significant Risk.** We must upload our users' potentially sensitive data to a third party. This has major privacy implications and requires explicit, clear user consent. It can be a point of friction and mistrust. | **Maximum Privacy.** User data is only ever sent to our own private, secure servers. This is a core part of our product's value proposition and a massive competitive advantage. |
| **Portability & Lock-In** | **None (Total Lock-In).** The custom model only exists on the provider's platform. We cannot take it with us. Switching providers means starting from scratch. | **Total Portability.** We own the model artifact. We can deploy it on-device, on our servers, or move it to any cloud provider with minimal friction. We control our own destiny. |

## 3. Conclusion & Strategic Choice

While third-party services offer convenience, they come at the cost of control, privacy, and long-term flexibility. For a consumer application like ProjectOne, where user trust and data privacy are paramount, the in-house approach is strategically superior.

By building our own pipeline, we create:

1.  **A Defensible Moat:** Our proprietary model, continuously improved by our users, is a unique asset that cannot be easily replicated.
2.  **A Powerful Privacy Narrative:** We can honestly market our product as the private, secure alternative to services that require sharing data with large tech companies.
3.  **Long-Term Cost Efficiency:** As the app scales, owning the model avoids a massive, recurring bill to a third-party provider.
4.  **Complete Control:** We are not beholden to any other company's roadmap, pricing changes, or terms of service.

Therefore, we will proceed with the plan to build our own agentic training pipeline. The initial investment in engineering is justified by the immense strategic advantages it provides.
