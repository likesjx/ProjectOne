# AI and MLOps Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for developing, deploying, and improving the AI models that power ProjectOne. Our approach is designed for maximum privacy, control, and long-term competitive advantage.

## 1. Core Philosophy: On-Device First, Centralized Training

Our strategy is built on a hybrid model:

-   **Inference (On-Device):** All user-facing AI tasks, primarily speech transcription, will run directly on the user's device. This ensures maximum privacy, offline capability, and low latency.
-   **Training (Centralized & Offline):** Model training and fine-tuning are complex, resource-intensive tasks. These will be handled on our private, secure backend infrastructure, not on user devices.

## 2. The Technology Stack

-   **On-Device Inference:** **MLX Swift** (or libraries built upon it, like **WhisperKit**). This allows us to run optimized models efficiently on Apple Silicon (macOS, iOS, etc.).
-   **Backend Training:** **MLX Python**. We will use the full-featured Python version of MLX on our backend servers to conduct training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.
-   **Model Hosting & Versioning:** **Hugging Face Hub**. All our proprietary models will be stored in a private repository on the Hugging Face Hub. This provides robust versioning (via Git), large file storage (LFS), and excellent tooling for model management.
-   **Training Orchestration:** **LangGraph**. The entire training pipeline will be managed by an autonomous agentic workflow built with LangGraph. This ensures the process is robust, observable, and scalable.

## 3. The MLOps Lifecycle: A Virtuous Cycle

We will implement a "human-in-the-loop" system to continuously improve our models. This creates a powerful, self-improving ecosystem.

1.  **Initial Deployment:** We start by deploying a high-quality, pre-trained base model for speech transcription.
2.  **Data Collection (The Feedback Loop):** The application will provide two mechanisms for users to help improve the model:
    *   **Transcription Correction:** Users can correct errors in transcriptions. The app saves the original audio paired with the corrected text.
    *   **Voice Donation:** Users can opt-in to record themselves reading from provided scripts. These scripts can be strategically designed to capture problematic accents, vocabularies, or phonetic patterns.
3.  **Secure Data Upload:** The collected `(audio, text)` pairs are uploaded from the user's device to our secure backend server. This is a critical step that requires user consent.
4.  **Agent-Driven Fine-Tuning:** The LangGraph-based "AI Model Trainer" agent automatically processes these new data batches. It validates the data, fine-tunes the latest model using MLX Python, and evaluates the new model's performance against a golden dataset.
5.  **Model Deployment:** If the new model is demonstrably better, the agent automatically pushes it to our private Hugging Face repository, creating a new version.
6.  **Dynamic App Updates:** The ProjectOne app on user devices periodically checks our backend for new model versions. When a new version is available, it downloads it and makes it the active transcription engine.

This cycle ensures that our AI models become more accurate and valuable over time, directly driven by user interaction. This proprietary data and the resulting model improvements form a significant competitive moat.
