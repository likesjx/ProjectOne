        Hey, so I just wrapped up that client call with Jennifer from TechCorp.

        in the Q4 rollout. *pause* The main thing is we need to get the API 
        documentation finalized by next Friday. Also, *thoughtful tone* I'm thinking 
        we should prioritize the mobile integration over the desktop version for 
        the initial launch. Oh, and I need to follow up with the engineering team 
        about those performance benchmarks.
