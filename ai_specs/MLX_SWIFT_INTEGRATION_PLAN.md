## Integration Strategy for ProjectOne

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
```swift
// Add MLX Swift as Package Dependency
// Repository: https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift.git
// Version: from: "0.10.0"

import MLX
import MLXRandom
import MLXOptimizers
import MLXNN
```

### Phase 2: TranscriptionEngine Enhancement

#### Current Architecture
```swift
protocol TranscriptionEngine {
    func transcribeAudio(_ audioData: Data) async throws -> TranscriptionResult
    func extractEntities(from text: String) -> [Entity]
    func detectRelationships(entities: [Entity], text: String) -> [Relationship]
}

// Current Implementation
class PlaceholderEngine: TranscriptionEngine {
    // Rule-based transcription
    // Pattern-based entity extraction
    // Heuristic relationship detection
}
```

#### Enhanced MLX Implementation
```swift
class MLXTranscriptionEngine: TranscriptionEngine {
    private let speechRecognitionModel: MLXModel
    private let entityExtractionModel: MLXModel
    private let relationshipModel: MLXModel
    
    init() async throws {
        // Load pre-trained models or train custom models
        speechRecognitionModel = try await loadSpeechModel()
        entityExtractionModel = try await loadNERModel()
        relationshipModel = try await loadRelationshipModel()
    }
    
    func transcribeAudio(_ audioData: Data) async throws -> TranscriptionResult {
        // Use MLX for audio processing and speech recognition
        let audioFeatures = try await extractAudioFeatures(audioData)
        let transcription = try await speechRecognitionModel.predict(audioFeatures)
        return TranscriptionResult(
            text: transcription.text,
            confidence: transcription.confidence,
            segments: transcription.segments
        )
    }
    
    func extractEntities(from text: String) -> [Entity] {
        // Use MLX for Named Entity Recognition
        let tokens = tokenize(text)
        let predictions = entityExtractionModel.predict(tokens)
        return parseEntityPredictions(predictions)
    }
    
    func detectRelationships(entities: [Entity], text: String) -> [Relationship] {
        // Use MLX for relationship extraction
        let contextVectors = createContextVectors(entities, text)
        let relationships = relationshipModel.predict(contextVectors)
        return parseRelationshipPredictions(relationships)
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph Enhancement

#### Semantic Embeddings
```swift
class MLXKnowledgeGraphService: KnowledgeGraphService {
    private let embeddingModel: MLXModel
    private let semanticSearchModel: MLXModel
    
    func generateEmbeddings(for entities: [Entity]) async throws {
        for entity in entities {
            let embedding = try await embeddingModel.embed(entity.name)
            entity.embedding = embedding
        }
    }
    
    func semanticSearch(query: String) async throws -> [Entity] {
        let queryEmbedding = try await embeddingModel.embed(query)
        let similarities = calculateCosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, entityEmbeddings)
        return rankedEntities(similarities)
    }
    
    func suggestRelationships(for entity: Entity) async throws -> [Relationship] {
        let entityEmbedding = entity.embedding
        let candidateRelationships = try await relationshipModel.predict(entityEmbedding)
        return filterAndRankRelationships(candidateRelationships)
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Memory System Enhancement

#### Intelligent Consolidation
```swift
class MLXMemoryConsolidation {
    private let importanceModel: MLXModel
    private let patternRecognitionModel: MLXModel
    private let summarizationModel: MLXModel
    
    func evaluateImportance(for entry: STMEntry) async throws -> Double {
        let features = extractMemoryFeatures(entry)
        let importance = try await importanceModel.predict(features)
        return importance.scalar
    }
    
    func recognizePatterns(in entries: [STMEntry]) async throws -> [Pattern] {
        let sequenceFeatures = createSequenceFeatures(entries)
        let patterns = try await patternRecognitionModel.predict(sequenceFeatures)
        return parsePatternPredictions(patterns)
    }
    
    func summarizeForLTM(entries: [STMEntry]) async throws -> String {
        let combinedText = entries.map(\.content).joined(separator: " ")
